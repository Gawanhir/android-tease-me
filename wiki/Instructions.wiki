This program is just a viewer of the teases referenced here or created by downloading teases using the original windows version of tease me.

Teases need to be put on the SD card under

Android/data/uk.co.ormand.teaseme/files

when you run the program for the first time it should create the directory
it will also create an empty file called .nomedia which will tell Android not to index the directory (you will not see pictures in the gallery etc.)
